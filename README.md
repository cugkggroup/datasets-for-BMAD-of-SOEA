 Ocean observation mission data set for BMAD of SOEA
 
 ## Basic data set
 
 The files ‘data-small-instance/data-moderate-instance’ are the instances of basic datasets, and 'conflict-small-instance/conflict-moderate-instance' include the conflicts in the datasets.

 The generation of the conflict data set is randomly selected from all conflict pair sets. We initialize all conflict pairs and filter according to whether they have overlapping observation targets.
 
  ## Constraint
  The generated code that contains the constraints in the program, including degree constraints and continuity constraints
